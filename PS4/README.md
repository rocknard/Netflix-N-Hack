# Netflix N Hack for PS4

> [!NOTE]
> The PS4 version requires very specific circumstances to work. Workarounds are included below.

## Compatibility

Before proceeding, ensure the following:

1. **Netflix (with license) installed on your PS4 below the latest version**
    - If you have an existing jailbreak, simply install the vulnerable version for your region [EU](https://orbispatches.com/CUSA00127?v=01.53)  [US](https://orbispatches.com/CUSA00129?v=01.53) [JP](https://orbispatches.com/CUSA02988?v=01.53)
    - This is useful if you can’t get BD-JB or are stuck using PPPwn.
    - If you are on the latest firmware, you *can* downgrade Netflix via MITM by downloading from PSN.  
      You **cannot jailbreak**, but you will be prepared if a new kernel exploit releases.

2. **PS4 Firmware version must be between 8.00 and 12.02** (required for the Lapse exploit)

## Downgrading Netflix

### Prerequisites
- Python
- mitmproxy
- Internet access

> [!Warning]
> Downgrading is experimental and may not work for you. If you accidentally update to 1.59 you cannot downgrade with MITM. **Extended storage images are planned**

> [!NOTE]
> please make sure you do this correctly. Backup restore will not backup licenses. Downgrade at your own risk!. if you accidentally upgrade to 1.59, you cannot downgrade without existing jailbreak
> 

### Install & Run Downgrade Proxy
```bash
# Install mitmproxy
pip install mitmproxy

# Start the downgrade proxy
mitmproxy -s downgrader.py --ssl-insecure
```
**Console Instructions**

Before continuing. set up your Internet connection and when it asks for proxy, click use, then input the local IP of the computer running mitmproxy 

On your PS4:

1. Go to Netflix **on the home screen**


2. Press **Options** on your controller 


3. Select **Check for Updates**



if its successfully downgraded but you get a "forced update message",**if you already have a jailbreak** FTP into /user/download/CUSA00XXX (whichever region you are in)
and delete "download0_info.dat"

---

## Exploit

### Public Server

Set your proxy in ps4 network settings to this:

> [!NOTE]
> **Address**: `172.105.156.37`
> **Port**: `42069`

Then simply open Netflix 


### Host Locally


### Start MITM Proxy

```bash
mitmproxy -s proxy.py
```

### Set your proxy in ps4 network settings to your local ip (machine running mitmproxy)

Then simply open Netflix on your PS4.
(Exploit initialization takes ~30 seconds.)

# Important Notes

> [!NOTE]
> If PS4 kernel panics, or lapse fails; restart the console and try again.
>
> if Netflix crashes, just restart Netflix

Once complete, the exploit will look for a payload in `/data/payload.bin` if it is not found it will look on the root of a plugged in USB drive for a file named `payload.bin` and will automatically copy it to `/data/payload.bin`.

after initial exploit, USB is no longer needed. 

if payload is not found on either the USB or `/data/payload.bin`, a binloader will spawn on port 9021 for you to send via netcat or equivalent
